# RAG Medical Assistant

## üìå Project Overview
This project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ‚Äî based AI assistant that leverages canonical medical manuals and domain texts to help answer clinical and healthcare questions. The goal is to reduce information overload, support decision-making, and demonstrate feasibility while emphasizing safety, traceability, and the need for human clinical oversight.

---

## üéØ Objective
- Build a RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant passages from curated medical manuals and augments a generative model to produce concise, referenced answers.
- Evaluate impact on information retrieval, diagnostic reasoning support, and potential for standardizing care workflows in non-critical decision contexts.
- Create a functional prototype (not for clinical use) demonstrating retrieval fidelity, answer quality, and traceability to source passages.

---

## üìö Knowledge Sources (examples)
> **Note**: Use only public / licensed / institutionally-approved manuals and avoid copyrighted content unless you have rights to use it.
- Example sources (replace with the exact manuals you will use): clinical guidelines, open medical textbooks, peer-reviewed review articles, drug formularies, diagnostic decision-support guidelines.

## üß≠ Approach (high-level)
1. **Data ingestion & indexing**  
   - Preprocess canonical texts into passages (chunking, metadata).  
   - Index passages using a vector store (e.g., FAISS, Milvus, or Elastic Vector Search).

2. **Retriever**  
   - Use a dense retriever (embedding model) to fetch top-k relevant passages for each query.

3. **Generator (RAG)**  
   - Supply retrieved passages to a generative language model (LLM) as context/prompts to produce answers with citations to source passages.

4. **Post-processing & Safety**  
   - Add hallucination checks, confidence scoring, and guardrails (e.g., ‚ÄúI am not a doctor ‚Äî consult a clinician‚Äù fallback).  
   - Log provenance: which passage(s) contributed to each answer.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details
- Retriever: embedding model (e.g., sentence-transformers) + FAISS or similar.
- Generator: open LLM / HF Transformers model used in a generation pipeline.
- RAG orchestration can be implemented with tools such as LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers Pipelines, or a custom wrapper.
- Notebook(s): `notebooks/` for experiments, `app/` for demo.

---

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Metrics
- **Retrieval metrics**: Recall@k, MRR (on held-out query‚Üírelevant passage pairs).
- **Generation metrics**: BLEU/ROUGE where applicable, but prefer **human evaluation** for clinical correctness and helpfulness.
- **Safety metrics**: rate of hallucinations, confidence-calibrated correctness, and false confident assertions.
- **Operational**: latency per query, average #passages retrieved.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Limitations & Safety
- **This prototype is NOT a clinical decision-making tool.** It is for research/demonstration only.
- Always include clear disclaimers in UI and README. Require human clinician review for any clinical recommendations.
- Keep an audit log of model outputs and sources for accountability.
- Ensure data / source licensing is compliant with copyright and institutional rules.
